# hello-world
My first hello-world.
I'm Joyce, I'm a student, a traveller, a teacher, a mom. My passions are reading, playing violin, sustainability, minimalism, anti-consumerism, cooking and eating delicious food that you have to wash the dirt off of before cooking it, being an LGBTQ+ ally, staying up-to-date with social issues, and language.
I live in Lima, Peru, with my partner and our two daughters.
